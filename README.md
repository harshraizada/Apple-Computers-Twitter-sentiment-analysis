Sentiment analysis remains one of the key problems that has seen extensive application of natural language processing. In this project given the tweets from customers about various tech firms who manufacture and sell mobiles, computers, laptops, etc, and I am identifying the sentiment towards such companies or products in tweets. 

All Tweets are classified into two labels
1) Positive - 0;
2) Neutral - 1;

Data fields
id - the id of twitter;
sentiment_type - sentiment type of tweet or tweet polarity;
tweet - tweet text.
